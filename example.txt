Champions League semi-finalists Tottenham are "living a dream", says manager Mauricio Pochettino.

Spurs host Dutch league leaders Ajax - who have knocked out Real Madrid and Juventus - in the first leg of their tie on Tuesday (20:00 BST).

It is Tottenham's first Champions League semi-final, though they reached the last four of the 1962 European Cup, losing to eventual winners Benfica.

"You need to set your dreams to infinity and beyond," said Pochettino.

"When you achieve things it's because you dream them. To be in the Champions League semi-final with Tottenham was a dream five years ago - but we're living the dream.

"You know we must always dream for the moon if you want to get something in the sky."
